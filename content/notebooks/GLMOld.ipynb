    "Sure, everybody knows what linear regression is (unless they are _seriously_ uncool), but only the most hip among us know that a linear regression is just a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Gaussian family and an identity link function. Say wut? Yes, GLMs are the old, unpopular parents who spawned famous children like linear and logistic regression. GLMs are generalized, which means that they are far less specific than a linear regression and far more adaptable to different types of prediction problems. A consequence of this, as we'll soon find out, is that there are a LOT of symbols, the notation is heavy, and shit gets crazy real fast.\n",

    "But GLMs are important, ok? They're not as cool as deep learning. Hell, they're not even as cool as decision trees! But they work well, they've been studied and in use for a long time, and they're fairly easy to interpret. Linear models are the \"Hello World!\" of machine learning. They also make for great job interview questions - don't ever trust a data scientist that can't give a sound, thorough explanation of a linear model!\n",

    "\n",
    "I always find it helpful to state what it is we're trying to accomplish, at a high level first, and then trying to drill down from there. To start, we have some data, $X$, that influences some outcome, some _result_ $Y$, in some way. Going one step further, we can say that our output $Y$ is produced by our data $X$ through _some process_.\n",

    "\n",
    "For clarity, let's use an example. We have some data on a house, say the size and number of bedrooms, and we know the price of the house. The data is known and fixed and the price is a result of the data being what it is. There is some process by which the price of a house is produced from the size and number of bedrooms of that house (a coarse model, to be sure). Say a house is 1000 square feet and has 2 bedrooms - that is our data. Let's say the price of the house is 1.5 million (it's in Palo Alto, people!) - that is our outcome. That process, in real life, might be that a seller decides that their 1000 sq ft and 2 bedroom house should go for 1.4 million, which we'll call the listing price. But due to some other unpredictable circumstances, the house doesn't sell for exactly 1.4 million. There is a bit of \"randomness\" in the final price of each house relative to the initial listing price. \n",

    "We have now actually specified a model by which the data produces the outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the data to find a reasonable expected value for the outcome.\n",
    "2. Inject randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can state this more generically. First, injecting that randomness is the same as saying that our outcome $Y$ is a random variable that is drawn from a probability distribution. For that house with 2 bedrooms and 1000 square feet, we would say that the price is drawn from _some_ distribution that has a mean of 1.4 million. The shape and width of that distribution must be determined - we'll use some data for that! Let's restate our goal:\n",

    "\n",
    "Second, we assume that the outcomes are all drawn from the same type of distribution (e.g. all examples are drawn from a Gaussian distribution, though the parameters of the distribution may be different for each example). For example, we might assume all of the outcomes are drawn from a Gaussian distribution or a Poisson distribution or a Binomial distribution. The type of distribution is a modeling choice and is selected beforehand. In a GLM, we use only specific types of probability distributions that can be fully specified by a finite number of distribution parameters. This assumption means that \"finding the probability distribution that the random variable $Y$ is drawn from\" actually means \"finding the **parameters** of the probability distribution that the random variable $Y$ is drawn from.\" Ok, so now we restate: \n",

    "For GLMs, it is possible to drill down even further because of yet another assumption. In a GLM, we limit ourselves to only specific types of parameterizable distributions - distributions from the _exponential family_. We will find out, in short time, all about this family and the mathematics that come with it. But for now, we'll just restate our problem to incorporate this knowledge:\n",

In fact, it is unlikely that the outcome was even generated this way! So, what we are truly after is to find, given our assumptions about how the data was generated, the parameters of the exponential family distribution that makes the data most _likely_ to have occurred. This is called maximum likelihood distribution and was introduced in [the first post of this series]().\n",

For most of this post, we will use a variable $\\eta = X\\beta$ which is sometime called the \"linear predictor.\" With that in mind, we say finally that our task now is to relate the linear predictor, $\\eta$, to the expected value of the outcome, $\\mu$.\n",

    "Intuitively, we are asking \"how does the expected value of $Y$ change as the data changes linearly?\" For an ordinary least squares model, we say that $E\\left[Y\\right]$ varies identically with $\\eta$. For a logistic regression, we need to restrict $E\\left[Y\\right]$ to lie in the interval [0, 1], so we cannot say the same. Instead, the sigmoid function is used to restrict $E\\left[Y\\right]$ to [0, 1]. If $Y$ were a count variable, we would want to restrict $Y$ to be positive. \n",
